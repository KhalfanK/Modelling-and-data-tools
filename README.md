# Modelling-and-data-tools
This was coursework that comprimised of three jupyter notebooks that I completed. The focus of the topics were modelling data through use of statistics and appropriate graphs, which helped with predictions and visualising error lines in the data. There was also a machine learning topic that can be seen in coursework 3.
